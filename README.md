# zpool
zpool is an open source Proof of Stake pool for the Nimiq blockchain.

## Status
The pool is currently in development and in a highly experimental phase. 

## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide a simple PoS pool implementation as a starting point for pool operators. 
zpool is small and simple to run, capable of handling a maximum of 500 stakers. Proper handling of more stakers is not gauranteed.
By making the pool open source, we hope to contribute to the Nimiq eco system as a whole providing other pool operators a blue print for their own implementations.

## Features
* keeps track of validator status, stake and stakers
* keeps track of validator rewards
* distributes rewards to relevant stakers
