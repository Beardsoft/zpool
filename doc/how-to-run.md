# How to run

## Requirements
In order to run zpool, you require the following:
* A validator. Pleas see [albatross on Github](https://github.com/nimiq/core-rs-albatross) as well as [the offical guide](https://www.nimiq.com/developers/build/set-up-your-own-node/becoming-a-validator).
* A Nimiq full node with RPC enabled. This can be the validator node, but can also be a separate node.
* A server to run zpool on. This server requires at minimum 2 threads (either physical or virtual threads) and 512mb of RAM.
